# Plot

The narrative is structured around a few different timelines and perspectives.

- A: Clare's experiences from just before her father's death, through her training, up until just before Tobias arrives in the city.
- B: Tobia's experiences from shortly before he arrives in the city up through the end of the book.
- C: Clare's experiences from after Tobias arrives in the city up through the end of the book.
- D: HH Holmes' past, from his childhood to the present day.
- E: Clare's experiences from her childhood up until the point that her father leaves the Order.
- F: The Pope's experience of the vision of the great evil. This is a prologue scene only.

The scenes from each of these timelines and perspectives are interwoven to create a sense of tension and mystery. It should roughly follow the structure of the plot of Batman Begins, with the protagonist's origin story being interwoven with the main plot. But because this is a novel rather than a screenplay, the structure can be more complex and the pacing can be more varied.
