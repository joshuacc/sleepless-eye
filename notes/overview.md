## Characters

### Clare O'Meara - The Protagonist

Note: Not sure about the last name. Probably want something that sounds a bit less similar to her first name and Aurora. (Lot's of A's and R's.)

- **Age:** 19?
- **Religion:** Catholic
- **Occupation:** Wealthy heiress, vigilante
- **Appearance:** 6'0", athletic build, green eyes, copper hair
- **Personality:** Brave, determined, compassionate, but also ruthless and vengeful. Not inclined to either doubt or introspection.

### Father Tobias Benson, SJ - Deuteragonist

- **Age:** Late 30s
- **Religion:** Catholic
- **Occupation:** Jesuit priest
- **Appearance:** 5'9", balding, with short black hair and dark brown eyes. Surprisingly muscular for a priest. Looks like a shorter Dave Bautista.
- **Personality:** Though his faith is firm, he is naturally skeptical. Easily angered, but quick to forgive, and capable of exercising considerable restraint even when angry. Relatively introspective.
- **Background:** He was accepted into the Jesuits much later in life. In his youth he roamed the streets of Chicago as part of a criminal gang.

### H. H. Holmes - Antagonist

- **Age:** 32
- **Religion:** Raised Methodist, but seems never to have been a believer.
- **Occupation:** Hotel proprietor, doctor/pharmacist/abortionist, scam artist, serial killer
- **Appearance:** 5'8", medium build, dark brown hair, striking blue eyes (described as mesmerizing), high forehead, thin mustache. Dressed well, often wearing tailored suits.
- **Personality:** Charming and charismatic, highly intelligent, grandiose and narcissistic, deceitful and untrustworthy, emotionally unstable with a volatile temper. No empathy or remorse. A master manipulator.
- **Goals:** To augment his murders further by creating a group of demonically possessed cyborgs using knowledge revealed to him by Aurora Nocturna Fairchild. He is unable to directly communicate with the demons, but can only summon them for a possession through a ritual. He is also seeking to gain immortality through the same means.

### Aurora Nocturna Fairchild - Antagonist

Note: Her middle name should not be revealed to the reader until the reveal of her true nature.

- **Age:** 22
- **Religion:** A form of occultism that is a more overtly demonic version of theosophy/anthroposophy/The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn
- **Occupation:** Wealthy heiress
- **Appearance:** 5'6", slender build, pale skin, black hair, dark brown eyes.
- **Personality:** Cold, calculating and manipulative, though she appears the opposite on the surface. She is a master of deception and intrigue. She has some mild attachments to friends and family, but is willing to sacrifice them for what she really cares about: power. For others, she doesn't care one way or the other what happens to them.
- **Background:** Raised by her wealthy father, who was a member of the secret society. She was groomed into demonic communion from a young age. She and Clare became friends when they were children and Clare's father was briefly involved with the society. She has been absent from Chicago for several years.
- **Goals:** To use Holmes to prototype the creation of demonic cyborgs. Though she doesn't reveal this, the ultimate goal is to make cybernetic enhancement a desirable and fashionable thing, so that she can activate them and seize power. Whether that is through overt force or through manipulation is not clear.
