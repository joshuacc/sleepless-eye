# Overview of Sleepless Eye

Note: The title is a placeholder, but is taken from the hymn _Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence_.

## Basics

- **Format:** Novel
- **Target audience:** Primarily adults, but suitable for teenagers as well.
- **Target length:** 80,000 - 100,000 words
- **Genre:** Science fiction (steampunk)/fantasy/theological thriller
- **Setting:** 1890s Chicago, around the time of the World's Fair, with some scenes at other times and places
- **Tone:** Pulpy steampunk thriller, but with moments of numinous awe and horror
- **Prose style:** Descriptive, but not overly so. The focus is on action and dialogue. Aiming for somewhere between the styles of Orson Scott Card, Ursula K. Le Guin and H. P. Lovecraft.
- **Dialog style:** It should evoke the time period, but not to the point of difficulty for modern readers.

## Concept

Like Batman and Robin if Batman was a religious visionary young woman like Joan of Arc (Clare), and Robin was a slightly curmudgeonly, and very skeptical Jesuit priest (Fr. Tobias) who is not afraid to use his fists.

It is primarily set in 1890s Chicago during the world fair. The villains are a fictionalized version of HH Holmes, who in addition to being murderous, also has a connection to the demonic and to steampunk technology which allows him to make people into demon-possessed cyborgs, and Aurora, a former childhood friend of Clare’s.

Clare and Aurora’s fathers were both involved in a spiritualist secret society which ultimately touched the demonic. Clare goes around Chicago fighting crime in disguise, armed with skills in martial arts and technology developed by a fictionalized Nicola Tesla. 

Clare’s alter-ego becomes known as a “devil” because of the dark cloak she wears and the electrical fire effect she can produce with it, as well as the electrical burns left by the sticks she fights with (an electrical stick similar to a cattle prod).

## Inspirations

- **Batman Begins:** The protagonist and the general outlines of the plot are inspired by Batman Begins, with the protagonist being a vigilante who uses fear to fight evil, and perhaps gain vengeance.
- **That Hideous Strength:** The secret society and their work with demons is inspired by the N.I.C.E. in That Hideous Strength. Though the society in Sleepless Eye is more explicitly demonic.
- **Joan of Arc:** The protagonist is inspired by Joan of Arc, in that she is a young woman experiencing visions and hearing voices, and is driven to fight by a sense of divine mission.
- **The novels of Charles Williams:** The theological and supernatural elements are inspired by the novels of Charles Williams, particularly War in Heaven and All Hallows' Eve.

## Characters

### Clare O'Meara - The Protagonist

Note: Not sure about the last name. Probably want something that sounds a bit less similar to her first name and Aurora. (Lot's of A's and R's.)

- **Age:** 19?
- **Religion:** Catholic
- **Occupation:** Wealthy heiress, vigilante
- **Appearance:** 6'0", athletic build, green eyes, copper hair
- **Personality:** Brave, determined, compassionate, but also ruthless and vengeful. Not inclined to either doubt or introspection.
- **Inciting incident:** The murder of her father and the subsequent angelic vision she saw.
- **Skills known:** Dancing, moving through high society
- **Skills she will learn:** Martial arts (from whom?)

### Father Tobias Benson, SJ - Deuteragonist

- **Age:** Late 30s
- **Religion:** Catholic
- **Occupation:** Jesuit priest
- **Appearance:** 5'9", balding, with short black hair and dark brown eyes. Surprisingly muscular for a priest. Looks like a shorter Dave Bautista.
- **Personality:** Though his faith is firm, he is naturally skeptical. Easily angered, but quick to forgive, and capable of exercising considerable restraint even when angry. Relatively introspective.
- **Background:** He was accepted into the Jesuits much later in life. In his youth he roamed the streets of Chicago as part of a criminal gang.

### H. H. Holmes - Antagonist

- **Age:** 32
- **Religion:** Raised Methodist, but seems never to have been a believer.
- **Occupation:** Hotel proprietor, doctor/pharmacist/abortionist, scam artist, serial killer
- **Appearance:** 5'8", medium build, dark brown hair, striking blue eyes (described as mesmerizing), high forehead, thin mustache. Dressed well, often wearing tailored suits.
- **Personality:** Charming and charismatic, highly intelligent, grandiose and narcissistic, deceitful and untrustworthy, emotionally unstable with a volatile temper. No empathy or remorse. A master manipulator.
- **Goals:** To augment his murders further by creating a group of demonically possessed cyborgs using knowledge revealed to him by Aurora Nocturna Fairchild. He is unable to directly communicate with the demons, but can only summon them for a possession through a ritual. He is also seeking to gain immortality through the same means.

### Aurora Nocturna Fairchild - Antagonist

Note: Her middle name should not be revealed to the reader until the revelation that she is the villain.

- **Age:** 22
- **Religion:** A form of occultism that is a more overtly demonic version of theosophy/anthroposophy/The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn
- **Occupation:** Wealthy heiress
- **Appearance:** 5'6", slender build, pale skin, black hair, dark brown eyes.
- **Personality:** Cold, calculating and manipulative, though she appears the opposite on the surface. She is a master of deception and intrigue. She has some mild attachments to friends and family, but is willing to sacrifice them for what she really cares about: power. For others, she doesn't care one way or the other what happens to them.
- **Background:** Raised by her wealthy father, who was a member of the secret society. She was groomed into demonic communion from a young age. She and Clare became friends when they were children and Clare's father was briefly involved with the society. She has been absent from Chicago for several years.
- **Goals:** To use Holmes to prototype the creation of demonic cyborgs. Though she doesn't reveal this, the ultimate goal is to make cybernetic enhancement a desirable and fashionable thing, so that she can activate them and seize power. Whether that is through overt force or through manipulation is not clear.
