# The Hermetic Order of the Dawning Night

Note: While this is loosely based on the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, it is not meant to be an accurate representation of that organization.

## Philosophy

Note: To lower level members, it is known as the Hermetic Order of the Dawning. The mention of night is reserved for higher level members.

Like Theosophy and other occult movements of the time, the Hermetic Order of the Dawning Night is a syncretic religion that draws on elements of Christianity, Eastern religions, and Western esotericism.

To lower level initiates, they teach that the goal of the order is to facilitate their members' spiritual enlightenment by communing with spiritual beings. To higher level initiates they reveal the full name of the order, as well as it's "deeper" teachings that the distinction between good and evil is an illusion, and only by fusing both can one achieve true enlightenment. This fusion is symbolized in the secret name of the society itself.
