Tobias looked up from his breviary as the train rumbled slowly to the station. Through the window he saw buildings rising where they hadn’t before. Chicago had changed while he was gone.

He turned back to the breviary, offered up a brief Te Deum, and collected his belongings.

While he waited for the train to stop his eye caught upon a newspaper headline.

“Southside Devil Revealed! First Likeness Produced From Eyewitness Accounts!”

Beside the headline sat an [engraving?] of a terrifying figure, hooded, in a black cloak, but surrounded by tongues of fire.

The man holding the paper glanced up, and following Tobias’s gaze, smiled, his teeth mostly hidden by a mustache full to overflowing. “A clergyman interested in the work of the devil?” he asked with a grin.

“I’m always interested in the work of the devil,” Tobias responded. “The same way that a soldier is interested in the work of the enemy.”

“So you think this is a devil, then? Appearing and driving everyone off the streets at night?”

Tobias frowned at the edge of mockery in the question. “That is not a devil. Satan and his [?] are bodiless spirits. Even if one of them did choose to appear in this way, what you see would merely be an illusion. Most likely some poor soul imagined the thing, and now anytime a drunkard is frightened he thinks this is what is pursuing him.”

When Tobias looked back all trace of mockery had faded from his interlocutor’s face. Now his eyes took Tobias in as if to measure him.

“It’s not often that I find such perceptiveness in a churchman,” he said.

Tobias shrugged. “It is the teaching of the Church. You must not know many priests.”

His [?] laughed loudly. “Right you are my friend. I’ve never had much time for religion. Perhaps I should make more time for it.” He offered his hand. “I’m [name?].”

“Father Tobias Benson,” he replied.

“Well, Father, if you ever want to take a tour of the World’s Columbian Exposition before it opens, send a not by my offices. We are doing amazing things.”

Tobias nodded as the train screeched to a halt. “God’s blessing on your endeavors. Chicago needs it.”

With that they each picked up their baggage and departed the train. Tobias prayed for patience as passengers shoved bustled about, acting more like cattle than men.

Finally he was out.

The throng dispersed as he made his way further from the great iron beast.

“Father Benson!”

Tobias turned, looking for the source of the cry.

“Father Tobias Benson!”

This time he spotted a cap waving in the crowd. As he got closer he could see that tit was a boy with a dirty face and hands calling for him.

“Are you Father Benson?” the boy asked.

“I am.”

“The other Father, he sent me to make sure you didn’t miss him.” The boy led him out of the crowd to the street where he found the incongrous sight of a bright new automobile piloted by a man wearing a leather cap, pilot goggles, and a black cassock with the red piping and buttons of a monsignor.

“Monsignor Doyle?” Tobias asked, taken aback that a parish priest would be piloting such an expensive contraption.

“Of course, of course, “ he replied, “just put your luggage in the back. It won’t bite.”

Tobias did as he was told, and was about to climb into the thing when there was a tug on his sleeve.

“Hey Mister… I mean Father, can I rid in it? None of my friends has been in one before.”

Tobias hesitated for a moment. It wasn’t his device. But if a priest was going to own such a luxury, it might as well bring some joy to this child.

He picked the boy up and put him in the back seat beside his bags. “Do you know your way home from [church]?”

The boy nodded.

Tobias saw Monsignor Doyle’s raised eyebrows above the goggles, which gave him an even more ridiculous countenance. He grinned as he stepped into the automobile’s front seat. “He knows the way home.”

Monsignor Doyle shook his head and laughed. They said you were a funny one.” With that he piloted the automobile down the street, slowly at first to avoid the pedestrians, but gradually moving more quickly.

The speed and rush of the wind unnerved Tobias, and he found himself looking back to check on their passenger.

The boy was standing in the middle of the seat looking backwards with hands spread to either side for balance. He swayed with every little turn of the vehicle.

Tobias’s stomach lurched as they hit a pothole in the street. Instinctively he reached for the boy, catching his hand just as he began to topple out of the mad contraption.

Quickly he pulled the boy back down to sit. But the boy looked up at him puzzled, completely unaware of the danger he had been in.

“I’d rather not have you falling out,” Tobias told him.

Monsignor Doyle turned to look at the boy.

“Monsignor!” exclaimed Tobias.

The older priest turned back to the road just in time to avoid running into the back of a carriage.

The rest of the drive was a blur to Tobias. His heart raced. He kept a firm grip on the boy until he finally asked, “Mister Father, can I go now?”

Tobias nodded numbly as he realized the vehicle had finally come to a halt. They were sitting outside the rectory of [church].

Monsignor Doyle took off his cap and goggles, revealing a rather mundane and slightly pudgy face. “We’ll get you settled in no time.”

--

The next morning, Tobias celebrated a private mass at one of the side altars of [church]. After concluding with the prayer to St. Michael [current in 1892-3?], he noticed a man standing at the back of the church.

He nodded to the man and proceeded to the sacristy, where he removed the [surplice?] and other sacred garments. But when he came back out he saw that the man was still there.

Tobias approached the man, who wore a thick full beard and a suit which was serviceable, but not fashionable. “Can I help you?”

“Your blessing father,” he said, bowing his head expectantly.

“Garrett?” Tobias exclaimed. “I almost didn’t recognize you with your face covered like that.”

Garrett looked up, seeming slightly embarrassed and scratched his chin through the deep beard. “It’s my missus. She likes it. And if she’s happy…” He trailed off, then mumbled under his breath, “But it itches.”

“You’re married? You must introduce me to her.”

“Of course, Father.” He bowed his head again. “Your blessing?”

Then Tobias understood. Garrett remembered the unruly boy he had been, but that was not who he saw now. Instead he saw a priest, a representative of the weight and authority of the Church. Garrett needed to see Father Benson, not Toby.

Tobias raised his right hand in blessing. “ May almighty God bless you. In nomine Patris et Filie et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.” [current?]

Garrett straightened back up, obviously more comfortable. “I was surprised to receive your letter. I had thought you were off to Rome for good.”

“As did I. But a priest must serve as the Church wills.” Even if we aren’t sure why the Church chose us.

“The questions you had for me?” asked Garrett.

“Are better discussed elsewhere. Do you know of a suitable place?”

Garrett nodded. “Come by my shop around six this evening. It’s the corner of [?] and [?]. The name is [?].

“I will meet you there.”

--

Tobias looked down at his watch again and sighed, putting it away. It was 6:30. He had taken far longer to find [shop][[ jclanton, 9/14/2014 1:05:00 PM]] than expected. Most of the old landmarks of the neighborhood had disappeared. In their places stood prosperous little shops. [Shop][[ jclanton, 9/14/2014 1:05:05 PM]] was one of the nicest. It had a neatly painted sign advertising fine leather gloves, saddles and… automobile furnishings?[[ Style tweak?]]

Tobias knocked on the door and opened it. There was light spilling from the back room, but goods and papers were strewn about the floor.

“Garrett?” Tobias called.

He heard an “Oh,” from the back room. Then Garrett’s burly figure filled the doorway. “Ah, Father. I apologize for the mess. I’ve had something important come up. Would it be too much of an imposition to delay our conversation till tomorrow morning?” He tucked an envelope into his pocket.

Tobias looked around the shop’s front room. “What happened here, Garrett?”

“It’s my own fault,” he said. “I was clumsy and fell…”

A womans voice cut in. “Garrett! Are you really going to stand there and lie to a priest?”

Garrett stepped back, frowning as a petite little woman stepped into the doorway beside him.

“Don’t you listen to him, Father. He’s trying to be too darned noble for his own good.” She shook her head and glared up at Garrett, who was at least 18 inches taller than her. “Lying to a priest.”

Garrett furrowed his eyebrows, clearly irritated. “If you had let me finish speaking, Hannah, you’d know that I wasn’t going to lie. I just wasn’t going to involve him in troubles that belong to me.”

“Troubles that belong to us, darling.”

“What kind of troubles, Garrett?”

The big man sighed and stepped into the back room, gesturing for Tobias to follow. His wife glided around to a seat in the back, looking perfectly proper, no hint that moments ago she had been lecturing her husband.

The room was full of the tools of the leatherworker: augers and knives, needles and thread, large and small pieces of leather; as well as  half-completed works.

Garrett took the envelope from his pocket and handed it to Tobias. On the face of the envelope was a drawing of a hand held up as if in warning. A chill ran down Tobias’s spine. How had Garrett come to the attention of the Black Hand?

He knew what would be inside the envelope without opening it. The Black Hand only had one message they cared to send: pay up or else. “How much?”

“No more than I can afford,” said Garrett.

Hanna sighed in exasperation. “We can only afford it if we give up on everything we’ve been working toward for the last five years. I won’t let you throw away the business just when things were coming together.”

Tobias pulled the note from the envelope while they continued arguing. The Black Hand was demanding [?][[ How much?]] dollars. Hannah had not exaggerated. That was likely the full value of [shop][[ Name?]].

He idly ran his fingers over the rosary in his pocket while trying to think of a way to help his friend. Tobias had some discretionary funds for the purpose of the investigation, but not enough to pay what they asked. In Rome he had only heard of problems with the Black Hand secondhand. They were killers and extortionists, but something — perhaps a fear of offending the Almighty too directly? — kept them from assaulting the Church. Then he realized what he had to do.

“How much of this can you get together Garrett? Without destroying your trade?”

Garrett frowned. “Maybe a quarter of what they’re asking.”

“When you have that, I will take it to them and persuade them to leave you alone from here on out.”

Garret’s frown deepened. “How?”

“I will make it clear you are under the protection of the Church,” Tobias said with more confidence than he felt. They might leave the Church alone, but that didn’t mean they would take kindly to the Church taking their prey from them[[ Awkward phrasing.]].

Hannah gave a satisfied nod, placed a small burlap sack on the table, and slid it over to Tobias.

“What is this?” Tobias asked.

“It’s the money you’ll need.”

Garrett had been leaning against the wall, but now he stood straight up. “This is why you made me keep the appointment. You knew he would offer to risk himself.”

“I didn’t know. I only hoped. Father Benson is obviously a clever man. He was bound to see that there is far less risk for himself than there is for you.”

Garrett opened his mouth to argue, but Tobias cut him off. “She’s right, Garrett. This is the only way.”

Hannah sat there with a stern but satisfied expression on her face. She was a formidable woman, and Tobias couldn’t help but admire her cunning.

Tobias took a deep breat and stood. “Well,” he said, “there’s no time like the present.”



--



The head of the local Black Hand wasn’t hard to find. It was an open secret that Bertinelli ran his operation out of the [name][[ jclanton, 7/13/2015 11:53:55 AM]] inn and saloon.

The patrons of the saloon eyed Tobias warily as he entered. Some of them were probably Bertinelli’s men and would not enjoy being reminded of their guilt before God.

Tobias approached the barkeeper. “Is Mr. Bertinelli here? I would like to speak with him.”

The bartender’s eyes flicked to a table in the corner. “Mr. Bertinelli’s not in right now.”

“Thank you,” said Tobias as he headed for the table.

An older man sat alone at the table. He was dressed in relatively fine clothes, but a nasty scar ran down the side of his neck. Tobias sat down in the chair across from him.

“What do you want with me?” he asked. His voice was ragged. “I don’t have any business with a priest.”

“But I have business with you.” Tobias took the money from his pocket and set it on the table. “This is a good faith offering.”

“For what?” The old criminal’s voice was filled with suspicion as he looked into the bag.

“Garrett O’Neal. We have an interest in him, and he has been placed under the protection of the Church.”

Bertinelli laughed.[[ What does the laugh sound like?]] And how much is the protection of the Church worth when your bishop can’t even protect himself? Unlike some, I don’t fear the Church.” He gestured for his men. “And my men fear me more than they do the Church.”

A hand fell on Tobias’s shoulder. He glanced at it and frowned. “You should reconsider your path, my son, before you incur the wrath of the Almighty.

“Take him out back,” said Bertinelli. “And give him a lesson in humility.”

The hand on his shoulder tightened. Tobias sighed. He’d given the man a chance.

Tobias grabbed the man’s wrist and spun out of his grasp, twisting the arm, then reached up and grabbed the man’s shoulder, forcing his face down to the table. Tobias considered whether he could afford to let the man go, but more of Bertinelli’s men were starting to surround him. He had to incapacitate him. “You should have repented,” he whispered, then twisted further, dislocating the shoulder.

The man screamed as several of his companions attacked. Tobias aimed blows to disable his opponents quickly. He couldn’t beat them all, but he might slow them enough to escape. He landed a fist just below one of his attackers’ ribs and kicked another in the groin.

Then the others were on top of him, dragging him to the floor. They began to kick him, but Bertinelli cut in, “Not here! Take him out back like I told you.”

They hauled Tobias to his feet. He grunted from the pain in his side, but he was in far better shape than the three men who had led the attack. Their groans brought him some satisfaction, though perhaps it shouldn’t have. Then his captors were dragging him out the back into a small alley. The only light came from the windows of the inn.

Tobias[[ Need to establish the number of captors.]] struggled, trying to slip free, but they held him too securely. He stopped struggling and silently prayed that the beating would be quick.

“Humility,” said one of his captors, leaning close to Tobias’s face. He was short, but powerfully built. “We’ll make you so humble, you’ll never walk again.” He stepped back and cracked his knuckles.

Then the darkness moved.

At first, Tobias thought his eyes were playing tricks on him, as the darkness came forward and swallowed one of his captors. The others didn’t seem to notice. Then it happened again, but this time the man cried out as he fell back out of the light.

Bertinelli’s men looked about wildly, trying to figure out where their friends had gone.

Tobias tried to break free while they were distracted, but the man holding him tightened his grip.

The darkness came forward again, this time resolving into a tall figure in a dark cloak, hood pulled forward. The figure stood as if waiting for something.

The squat man who had threatened Tobias said, “We’re not afraid of you!” Then three of the remaining men rushed the figure.

Gracefully, the cloaked figure stepped back and caught the squat man’s wrist in a gloved hand. The squat man yelled and collapsed to the ground.

As if in a dance, the figure stepped to the side and deflected a blow intended for his stomach. As they made contact, this man too fell to the ground.

The dark figure reached up and caught the third man by the back of his neck and swept his feet out from under him.

Then the figure turned toward Tobias and the man holding him.

A thrill of fear ran through Tobias as that menacing gaze fell upon him. It took an effort to remind himself that the figure had not threatened him in any way. Still, his pulse raced, and he could feel his captor’s fear in sweaty palms. In that, at least, they were united. There was only darkness within that hood.

To Tobias’s surprise, the figure stepped back into the darkness. He let out a small sigh of relief.

Then an eerie blue light sprang into being. At first he wasn’t sure what to make of it, then he saw. Blue tongues of flame rose from the figure, as if it were on fire, but it was not consumed.

He fell to the ground as his captor cried out and fled. Tobias scrambled back, preparing to flee as well. But the flames dissipated and the figure retreated back into the darkness it had come from.

Tobias offered a prayer of thanksgiving as he collected himself. Whatever he had seen, that was not a devil. Devils had no need or reason to beat a gang of street toughs. In fact, the only reason he could think of that anyone had to fight this particular group was to help him.

He stood and walked over to where the squat man was lying. He was groaning. Tobias took his hand and held it up to the light. There was a small burn where the figure had grabbed him. What had caused that? Tobias shook his head. He needed to think about that later. Right now he had an opportunity to keep Garrett and Hannah safe.

He straightened his cassock and dusted himself off. He would need to make a strong impression.

He strode back into the inn, slamming the door behind him and headed straight for Bertinelli’s table.

The old man stared at him.

“Ask your men what happens to those who threaten the Church. This is your last warning. Do not interfere again.” Then he stormed out the front door.
