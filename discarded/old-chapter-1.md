Clare O’Meara whirled to the tune of the gramophone, her feet keeping perfect time with the music. Sweat beaded on her forehead from the exertion. She had been practicing her steps for hours.

Let the other girls try making fun of her next time. She might not have the ridiculous wasp-waisted figure they seemed to prize so much, but they would all faint trying to keep up with her. Idiot tightlacers.

Clare slowed her pace to the match the music. She couldn’t care less about any of the young men who attended the dances, but she wouldn’t mind pulling their eyes away from those fragil flowers.

The music picked up speed again and she began a series of quick turns.

“Mistress Clare,” came an unwelcome voice.

She went into the next turn.

“Mistress Clare,” She sounded exasperated.

Clare turned faster and faster.

“Mistress Clare!”

She spun to a halt as the music ended, and paused for a moment to catch her breath.

The older woman frowned disapprovingly.

“What is it, Brigitte?”

“You’re late for today’s business meeting with your father.”

Clare sighed. Her father acted as if she would run the company one day. He just wouldn’t accept that she had no interest in it. “Thank you, Brigitte.” Clare started for her father’s office.

The older woman cleared her throat. “Perhaps you would consider tidying up before meeting your father’s guest?” Her voice didn’t hold out much hope of it happening.

“My father’s guest can see me as I am. He’s doing business with my father, not me.”

Brigitte nodded, but the disapproving look[[ Frown?]] remained.

Clare walked quickly down the long stairway, pulling back her hair so it didn’t fall in her face. When she reached her father’s door she paused and knocked.

“Come,” her father called.

As always, Mr. O’Meara sat behind his intricately worked desk smoking a pipe. The room was filled with smoke, which meant he had been thinking harder than normal[[ Usual?]]. “Ah, Clare. I’m glad you’re here.”

Clare winced slightly, feeling guilty. Her father never said anything to make her feel badly about being late, but somehow that made it worse.

“Mr. Tesla, my daughter Clare,” he addressed his guest. “Clare, this is Mr. Nikola Tesla.”

The guest turned and stood. He was a young man in a fashionable suit, with a thin mustache. Most of her father’s business contacts were middle aged or older. What did this young man have to offer?

“Pleased to make your acquaintance, Miss O’Meara,” he said with a trace of an accent that Clare didn’t recognize..

Her father gestured for them to be seated, and Clare took up her seat to the side of the desk. “Please continue.”

Tesla nodded. “As I was saying, this device is capable of incapacitating a man, regardless of size, for several minutes after contact. Yet it causes no permanent harm.”

“I see,” said Mr. O’Meara. “This is undoubtedly very interesting from a scientific point of view. However, I’m not certain what advantage it holds over a revolver.”

Clare could see Tesla bristle, but she wondered the same thing. Why would anyone use this device?”

“In some respects it is inferior to a revolver. It will not kill anyone. And it cannot be used at a distance. But it has other advantages.”

“What advantages?” asked Clare. This was much more interesting than her father’s typical business meetings.

Tesla smiled, looking more confident. “Due to the nature of the device, it can be adapted to a multitude of forms.” He gestured to Mr. O’Meara’s cane, which leaned against a bookshelf. “Imagine a walking stick that could stop an attacker with a tap, or an ordinary-looking glove that can put a man down with a touch.”

Clare began to understand the appeal. “You’re suggesting that this device is best suited as a concealed method of self-defense.”

“Precisely.” Tesla smiled confidently. “I am experimenting with other uses of the technology, but for the moment that seems to be its most practical use.”

“That’s all very well,” said Mr. O’Meara, “but why come to me with this? You already have partners with more expertise in electrical matters.”

Tesla grimaced. “My partners are men of limited vision. They don’t want to deal with weapons. They don’t understand that electrical power changes everything, including how we fight. You on the other hand, know the value of weapons. This device would complement your existing firearm manufacture.”

Clare interjected. “The idea is certainly intriguing, but I believe a demonstration is in order.”

“Of course.” Tesla reached for a bag sitting beside him on the floor.

“Unfortunately,” said Mr. O’Meara, “I will need to make preparations for this demonstration. Perhaps tomorrow?”

Tesla was clearly disappointed, but nodded.

“Clare, will you show Mr. Tesla out?”

Clare stood, concerned, and led Tesla from the office. Something was troubling her father. Ordinarily he would have walked with Tesla himself.

“Mr. O’Meara is not as I expected,” said Tesla, as they walked to the front door.

“I apologize for that. He seems unusually distracted today.”

Tesla shook his head. “That is not what I mean. A captain of industry like your father must have much to distract him. But he clearly trusts your judgment and defers to it. And I think he is wise to do so.”

For a moment Clare stared at him, unsure whetehr he was trying to flatter her. But his eyes seemed sincere. “I just tried to ask the questions he would have if he had been less distracted.”

“Then he has done a remarkable job in teaching you. I hope that I will see you tomorrow.”

In her surprise, clare hadn’t realized they were at the door. She nodded. “I will be there.”

As Tesla departed, Clare hurried back to her father’s office. He was puffing away on his pipe, staring at the ceiling, and didn’t even notice that she was back.

She sat down across from him and waited. She’d sen him distracted before, but not like this. Not since her mother died. What was bothering him so?

Finally he looked back down and started, as if she had sneaked up on him.

“So are you going to tell me?” asked Clare.

“Tell you what?” Her father wasn’t very good at pretending to be slow-witted.

“Whatever it is that’s causing you to burn through a bushel of tobacco.” She waved her hands at the smoke which filled the room.

“Nothing you need to worry about.” He took the pipe out of his mouth and smiled at her, though it was clearly an effort.

“You did well today, leading the discussion witout me really being here. I’ll make a businesswoman of you yet.”

Clare just shook here head. That wasn’t going to happen, even if she had managed to learn a bit along the way.

“Oh,” he said, sticking the pipe back in his mouth as he rummaged through his desk drawer. “I have something for you.”

He pulled out a small wooden box and handed it to her. The outside bore a silver inlaid engraving of an angel. Inside she found a silver medal depicting St. Michael’s victory over the dragon, with his sword held high.

“I know it’s early,” he said. Michaelmass — and Clare’s birthday — was tomorrow.

She held up the medal on its chain and slipped it over her head. “It’s lovely.”

“I also have something else for you.”

Clare raised an eyebrow. More? That was unusual. Despite their wealth, he had always encouraged Clare towards living relatively modestly, avoiding the excesses typical of wealthy children. Why give her more gifts?

“Tomorrow night we are hosting a party.”

Clare’s confusion deepened. Here father hated parties.

“All the young men and women from our social circles will be atttending.” He paused for a moment while Clare eyed him warily. “And the central event will be a dance where you can put those corsetted snakes into their proper place.”

Clare laughed in delight and before she realized it was hugging her father while he tried to keep from dropping the pipe. “That is a fantastic present!”

“I’m looking forward to seeing their faces tomorrow. Assuming you don’t crush me first.”

She squeezed him hard one more time and let go. Tomorrow night would be fun.

Musicians played softly in the background as the guests arrived. Most of the arrivals wore the latest fashions. The women’s dresses had elaborate patterns designed into the fabric. Clare’s own dress was flatteringly cut, but quite reserved by comparison.

Most of the servants were busy preparing the mansion for the evening party. Even though she was in the courtyard, she could hear the bustle. Her father had insisted she watch Tesla’s demonstration, though to be fair she was curious enough that she might have come regardless.

Tesla himself looked bored, which she took as a sign of his confidence. Mr. O’Meara was somber, but not as distracted as he had been yesterday. It looked to Clare like he had reached some sort of decision. For herself, Clare just wished they would hurry things up.

At last quiet Jack came around the corner, pulling a mangy dog on a rope behind him. Jack was Clare’s driver, but she was half convinced that her father had hired him due to his intimidating size.

The dog fought to break free, but it didn’t have a chance against Jack’s strength.

“You’re sure she’ll be okay?” the big man asked.

Mr. O’Meara glanced at Tesla, who was pulling something from his bag. “So I have been assured.”

The device Tesla had pulled out looked like a wooden baton about two feet long with a brass cap on one end and a leather grip on the other. “It will hurt some,” Tesla said, “but it won’t do any real harm.”

Mr. O’Meara gave Jack a questioning look, asking for his approval. Jack loved animals and hated to see them hurt, even when it was necessary.

Jack nodded in reply and tried petting the dirty dog, but it backed away. The big man sighed and gestured for Tesla to proceed.
